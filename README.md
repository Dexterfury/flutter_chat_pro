## Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a Firebase Application and connect the Application to Firebase

3. After your application is connected to Firebase you  will have the following files

  - ios/Runner/GoogleServices-info.plist

4. After the above you can delete the sample files below because you dont need them
  - lib/firebase_options_sample.dart
